      <h2>What is StockSpot?</h2>
      <p>StockSpot is a free service that sends real-time alerts when products restock or prices drop across major online retailers. We monitor thousands of products so you don't have to.</p>
      <p>Whether you're hunting for hard-to-find gaming consoles, waiting for your favorite sneakers to come back in stock, or looking for deals on everyday items, StockSpot keeps you in the loop.</p>

      <h2>Who is StockSpot for?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Gamers</strong> looking for PS5s, Xbox Series X, graphics cards, and other gaming hardware</li>
        <li><strong>Sneaker collectors</strong and resellers wanting instant notification of releases and restocks</li>
        <li><strong>Trading card enthusiasts</strong waiting for Pokemon, Magic, and sports cards</li>
        <li><strong>Tech shoppers</strong hunting for deals on laptops, phones, and electronics</li>
        <li><strong>Deal hunters</strong who want price drop notifications across multiple retailers</li>
        <li><strong>Anyone</strong who's tired of checking websites manually multiple times per day</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The Problem We Solve</h2>
      <p>Modern online shopping has a frustrating challenge: popular items sell out in seconds. Hard-to-find products rarely show their stock status until they're already gone.</p>
      <p>Checking multiple websites multiple times a day is exhausting. By the time you see an item is available, it's already sold out. StockSpot solves this by monitoring retailers 24/7 and alerting you the moment something you want becomes available.</p>

      <h2>How We Work</h2>
      <p>StockSpot monitors major retailers including Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart, Target, eBay, and many others. When we detect that an item matching your interests is back in stock or has dropped in price, we send you an email notification immediately.</p>
      <p>You maintain complete control over which categories and retailers to monitor. You can update your preferences at any time or unsubscribe instantly.</p>

      <h2>Our Commitment</h2>
      <p><strong>Free:</strong> StockSpot will always be free to use. No hidden fees, no premium tiers required for basic functionality.</p>
      <p><strong>Honest:</strong> We operate transparently. We disclose our affiliate relationships clearly. We never make false claims or overpromise.</p>
      <p><strong>Private:</strong> We respect your data. We never sell your information to third parties. We keep your email addresses secure and use them only to send you alerts you've requested.</p>
      <p><strong>Simple:</strong> StockSpot works via email. No apps to download, no accounts to manage. Just sign up, choose your interests, and receive alerts.</p>

      <h2>Affiliate Relationships</h2>
      <p>StockSpot participates in affiliate programs with retailers including Amazon Associates. When you click a deal link from StockSpot and make a purchase, we earn a small commission at no cost to you. This helps us keep the service free.</p>
      <p>Our affiliate relationships do not influence which deals we show you. We alert you to restocks and price drops based purely on what's actually happening, not based on commission potential. <a href="affiliates.html">Learn more about our affiliate practices</a>.</p>

      <h2>Future Plans</h2>
      <p>We're constantly improving StockSpot. In the future, we may add:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>More advanced filtering and customization</li>
        <li>SMS/text alerts as an alternative to email</li>
        <li>Browser notifications for web access</li>
        <li>Expanded retailer coverage</li>
        <li>Better mobile experience</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Our goal is always the same: help you find the products you want at the prices you're willing to pay.</p>
