        <h1>Affiliate Disclosure & Transparency</h1>

      <h2>Important Disclosure</h2>
      <p><strong>StockSpot is a participant in affiliate advertising programs, including the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program.</strong></p>
      <p>As an Amazon Associate, StockSpot earns a commission from qualifying purchases made through Amazon affiliate links. We may also participate in affiliate programs with other retailers including Best Buy, Walmart, Target, eBay, and others.</p>
      <p><strong>When you click a deal link from StockSpot and make a purchase, StockSpot may earn a small commission at no additional cost to you.</strong> This commission structure is how we are able to provide StockSpot for free.</p>

      <h2>Plain Language Explanation</h2>
      <p>Here's what this means in simple terms:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>You pay the same price whether you click through StockSpot or go directly to the retailer</li>
        <li>No hidden fees or markups are added to your purchase</li>
        <li>Retailers pay us a small percentage of the sale (typically 1-5%, depending on the program)</li>
        <li>This commission is built into retailers' normal advertising budgets and doesn't cost you anything extra</li>
        <li>You get free deal alerts and quick access to restocks; we get to keep the lights on</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How This Affects What We Show You</h2>
      <p><strong>Our affiliate relationships do not influence which deals we show you.</strong></p>
      <p>StockSpot alerts you to restocks and price drops based purely on what's actually happening with products and pricing. We do not:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Prioritize deals from programs with higher commissions</li>
        <li>Hide or deprioritize deals from programs with lower commissions</li>
        <li>Recommend products based on commission potential</li>
        <li>Include fake or inflated discount information</li>
        <li>Participate in misleading marketing practices</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Our goal is to show you accurate, real-time information about product availability and pricing. Our business model depends on our users trusting us, which means being honest and transparent.</p>

      <h2>Amazon Associates Program Specific</h2>
      <p><strong>As an Amazon Associate, we are required to include this notice:</strong></p>
      <p><em>StockSpot is a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for sites to earn advertising fees by advertising and linking to amazon.com. Amazon and the Amazon logo are trademarks of Amazon.com, Inc. or its affiliates.</em></p>

      <h2>Other Affiliate Programs</h2>
      <p>We may participate in affiliate programs with other major retailers including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Best Buy Affiliate Program</li>
        <li>Walmart Affiliate Program</li>
        <li>Target Affiliate Program</li>
        <li>eBay Partner Network</li>
        <li>Other retailer-specific affiliate programs</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We disclose all affiliate relationships clearly wherever deal links are displayed.</p>

      <h2>Our Commitment to Honesty</h2>
      <p>We understand that affiliate disclosure matters. We want you to know:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>We are transparent:</strong> We disclose our affiliate relationships clearly and upfront</li>
        <li><strong>We are honest:</strong> We show you real data, not influenced by commission amounts</li>
        <li><strong>We are trustworthy:</strong> You can rely on StockSpot to tell you the truth about deals</li>
        <li><strong>We are independent:</strong> We make our own decisions about what deals to show, not dictated by retailers</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Why We Use Affiliate Links</h2>
      <p>StockSpot is free because we use affiliate revenue to cover our costs. Without affiliate commissions, we would need to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Charge a subscription fee</li>
        <li>Show advertisements</li>
        <li>Sell your data to advertisers</li>
        <li>Limit the service to fewer users</li>
      </ul>
      <p>By accepting affiliate revenue, we can keep StockSpot completely free and avoid all those less-desirable options.</p>

      <h2>Full Disclosure Statement</h2>
      <p>StockSpot earns revenue from affiliate commissions. When you purchase through StockSpot deal links, we receive a commission from the retailer. This commission does not increase your costs and helps us continue providing this service for free. All product information and deal alerts are based on real data and are not influenced by commission considerations.</p>

      <h2>Questions?</h2>
      <p>If you have questions about our affiliate practices, how we earn revenue, or how our commission structure works, please email us at <strong>support@stockspotdeals.com</strong></p>
      <p>We're committed to transparency and happy to explain any aspect of our business model.</p>
